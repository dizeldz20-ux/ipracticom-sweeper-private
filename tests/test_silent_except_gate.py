"""v1.5.0 Slice 5 — Silent-except gate.

The repo's convention is that every ``except`` block must do *something*
visible (log, raise, fall through, return a sentinel). The pattern
``except X: pass`` / ``except X: continue`` / bare ``except:`` swallow
errors silently and is forbidden in committed code.

This test enforces the rule. It scans ``src/ipracticom_sweeper`` for
the forbidden patterns and fails the suite if any are found — every
swallowed exception should be wrapped in ``_log.log_suppressed`` (or
similar) so the operator can see the failure in the journal.

Adding new silent blocks in a future commit will turn this test red;
fixing them with ``log_suppressed`` keeps it green.

The initial baseline of 50 silent blocks is tracked in
``CHANGELOG.md`` under [1.5.0] — the test enforces the *new* rule
(strict-zero) rather than the current state. See
``test_silent_except_baseline.py`` for the per-file count snapshot
that this gate supersedes once the team is ready to require zero.
